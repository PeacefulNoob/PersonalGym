                My love towards sports began at a very early age, in a form of the most popular
                one- football. As time went by, my ambition was rising. I strived to get stronger,
                faster, better. So I trained hard, pushing my limits day after day. In order to achieve
                better results, I started learning and studying about fitness, sports science, nutrition
                physical therapy. After a while, I decided to put my knowledge into use. As a football
                player there was a constant need to become faster, so athletic training became a
                necessity- I trained like an Olympic sprinter. Little did I know how things were about
                to change. 
             </p><br>

                Full of motivation and will I adopted a morning routine of training on a
                snowy Olympic track. However, lacking experience, my warm ups weren’t done properly,
                which led to a disaster. As I was doing my rounds of sprints on the track, in one
                split second I slipped and turned my knee on the inside. That’s all it took- a second,
                and my life was about to be changed forever.</p><br>
            <p class="">
                At first I was told I won’t be able to
                play football for three months, which prolonged to six. Desperate and in need of
                physical activity, I decided to take the matter into my own hands. This is where
                my fitness journey starts. I wanted to understand my injury and do what I can to
                make it better. Hungry for knowledge, I devoted myself to physioneurobiology ,
                biomechanics and physical therapy. I started studying at SAFS (Swiss Academy of
                Fitness and Sports) and working in a gym to become a professional trainer. As
                I gained more and more knowledge I started applying those techniques into my
                training and rehabilitation. They have proven to be more than beneficial. I
                overcame my injury and became stronger than ever. Indescribable feeling of
                victory opened my eyes- that’s it! That’s what I want to do and devote myself
                to!
            </p>
            <p class=""><br>
                I graduated at SAFS and fulfilled my ambition at becoming fitness and
                personal trainer. Every day spent working at the gym is a blessing, because
                it gives me the ability to vivify in you the same victorious feeling I have
                felt, while simultaneously improving the most important thing in life- your
                health.
