'introSubtitle' => 'About the trainer',
'intro1'=>'My love towards sports began at a very early age, in a form of the most popular one- football. As time went by, my ambition was rising. I strived to get stronger, faster, better. So I trained hard, pushing my limits day after day. In order to achieve better results, I started learning and studying about fitness, sports science, nutrition physical therapy. After a while, I decided to put my knowledge into use. As a football player there was a constant need to become faster, so athletic training became a necessity- I trained like an Olympic sprinter. Little did I know how things were about to change.',
'intro2'=>'Full of motivation and will I adopted a morning routine of training on a snowy Olympic track. However, lacking experience, my warm ups weren’t done properly, which led to a disaster. As I was doing my rounds of sprints on the track, in one split second I slipped and turned my knee on the inside. That’s all it took- a second, and my life was about to be changed forever.',
'intro3'=>'At first I was told I won’t be able to play football for three months, which prolonged to six. Desperate and in need of physical activity, I decided to take the matter into my own hands. This is where my fitness journey starts. I wanted to understand my injury and do what I can to make it better. Hungry for knowledge, I devoted myself to physioneurobiology , biomechanics and physical therapy. I started studying at SAFS (Swiss Academy of Fitness and Sports) and working in a gym to become a professional trainer. As I gained more and more knowledge I started applying those techniques into my training and rehabilitation. They have proven to be more than beneficial. I overcame my injury and became stronger than ever. Indescribable feeling of victory opened my eyes- that’s it! That’s what I want to do and devote myself to!',
'intro4'=>'I graduated at SAFS and fulfilled my ambition at becoming a personal trainer. Every day spent training working with people is a blessing, because it gives me the ability to vivify in you the same victorious feeling I have felt, while simultaneously improving the most important thing in life- your health',

'nutrition2' => 'I have good news for you! You don't need a diet to achieve your goals because that just won't do it if you are looking for long-term results. This is reality.

'recovery2'=>'Those three components-TRAINING, NUTRITION and RECOVERY, can't go without one another if you want to achieve your personal goals in the best way possible.
